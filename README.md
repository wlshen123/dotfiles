## vimrc

This vimrc uses Vundle for plugin management. Visit the [Vundle github page](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
for details on how to install and use Vundle

Once Vundle is installed, running the :PluginInstall command should get everything working out of the box.

This vim config uses `-` as the leader by default.

TODO: add a table of custom macros and abbrevations.

## i3config

Very similar to default. Key binding-wise, `jkl;` was moved to `hjkl` for better compatibility.
Horizontal split was moved to $mod+n

Certain apps run on startup, and some are bound to corresponding workspaces.
